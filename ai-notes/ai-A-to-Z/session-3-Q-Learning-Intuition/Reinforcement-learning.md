# In-Depth Notes on Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?
- **Definition**: Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The agent performs **actions**, receives **rewards** or **penalties**, and aims to maximize the cumulative reward over time.
- **Analogy**: It’s like training a dog—give treats for good behavior (positive reward) and withhold them for bad behavior (negative or zero reward). Over time, the dog learns the best actions through trial and error.
- **Goal**: Learn an optimal **policy** (strategy) that dictates the best action to take in each situation to maximize long-term reward.

## Key Concepts in RL

### 1. Core Elements
- **State (\(s\))**: A representation of the environment at a given time (e.g., position in a game).
- **Action (\(a\))**: A choice the agent makes (e.g., move left, jump).
- **Reward (\(R\))**: Scalar feedback from the environment (e.g., +1 for success, -1 for failure).
- **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))**: \(0 \leq \gamma < 1\), balances immediate vs. future rewards. A smaller \(\gamma\) prioritizes short-term gains.

### 2. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
- **Definition**: An MDP is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in environments where outcomes are partly random and partly controlled by the agent.
- **Components**: \( (S, A, P, R, \gamma) \):
  - \(S\): Set of states.
  - \(A\): Set of actions.
  - \(P(s'|s, a)\): Transition probability to next state \(s'\) given state \(s\) and action \(a\).
  - \(R(s, a)\): Reward function.
  - \(\gamma\): Discount factor.
- **Markov Property**: The future is independent of the past given the present:
  ```markdown
  P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) = P(s_{t+1} | s_0, a_0, \ldots, s_t, a_t)
  ```
- **Types**:
  - **Deterministic Search**: Transitions are fixed (e.g., \(s' = f(s, a)\)).
  - **Non-Deterministic Search**: Transitions are probabilistic (e.g., \(P(s'|s, a)\)).

- **Paper**: ["A Survey of Applications of Markov Decision Processes" by D.J. White (1993)](https://example.com) explores MDPs in various domains.

## Bellman Equation

### Definition
- The **Bellman Equation** is based on the **principle of optimality**: The optimal value of a state is the immediate reward plus the discounted optimal value of the next state.
- **Forms**:
  - **Value Function**: Expected cumulative reward starting from state \(s\) under policy \(\pi\):
    ```markdown
    V^\pi(s) = E_\pi [ R_{t+1} + \gamma V^\pi(s_{t+1}) | s_t = s ]
    ```
    ![Bellman Equation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342cb01f-334e-4b61-bab7-acd710bf4702)
    *Image Description*: The first Bellman Equation image shows the recursive value function \(V^\pi(s)\) breaking down into immediate reward and discounted future value.
  - **Q-Function**: Expected reward for taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) and following \(\pi\) thereafter:
    ```markdown
    Q^\pi(s, a) = E_\pi [ R_{t+1} + \gamma Q^\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) | s_t = s, a_t = a ]
    ```
  - **Optimal**:
    ```markdown
    V^*(s) = \max_a [ R(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s, a) V^*(s') ]
    ```
    ![Updated Bellman Equation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8979e32-ba6e-4bd0-af25-a1566d74a735)
    *Image Description*: The updated Bellman Equation image includes the summation over next states \(s'\) with transition probabilities, illustrating the optimal value computation.

#### Concept Visualization

*Image Description*: This image illustrates the Bellman Equation concept, showing how the value of a state depends on immediate reward and future states recursively.

#### Reference
- **Paper**: ["The Theory of Dynamic Programming" by Richard Bellman (1954)](https://example.com) introduces this recursive formulation.

## Policy vs. Plan
- **Policy (\(\pi\))**: A mapping from states to actions (\(\pi(s) \to a\)) or probabilities (\(\pi(a|s)\)). It’s dynamic and adaptive.
  - **Deterministic**: \(a = \pi(s)\).
  - **Stochastic**: \(P(a|s) = \pi(a|s)\).
- **Plan**: A fixed sequence of actions, less flexible than a policy. RL favors policies for adaptability in uncertain environments.

### Adding a Living Penalty
- Introduce a small negative reward (e.g., \(-0.01\)) per step to discourage infinite loops or delays, encouraging efficiency:
  ```markdown
  R(s, a) = R_{\text{task}}(s, a) - 0.01
  ```

---

## Q-Learning Intuition

### Definition
- **Q-Learning** is a model-free, off-policy RL algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function \(Q^*(s, a)\) without needing the transition model \(P(s'|s, a)\).

### Update Rule
- Based on Temporal Difference (TD) learning:
  ```markdown
  Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) ]
  ```
  - \(\alpha\): Learning rate (step size).
  - \(r\): Immediate reward.
  - \(\max_{a'} Q(s', a')\): Best future value estimate.

### Intuition
- The agent explores (e.g., via \(\epsilon\)-greedy: random action with probability \(\epsilon\)) and updates \(Q\) based on observed rewards and future estimates.
- Converges to \(Q^*\) under sufficient exploration and decaying \(\alpha\).

### Example (Table-Based)
- From Juliani’s blog: A grid-world where \(Q(s, a)\) is stored in a table, updated as the agent navigates.

---

## Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

### Definition
- **TD Learning** combines ideas from dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods, updating value estimates based on the difference between predicted and actual outcomes:
  ```markdown
  V(s) \leftarrow V(s) + \alpha [r + \gamma V(s') - V(s)]
  ```
  - **TD Error**: \( r + \gamma V(s') - V(s) \).

### Key Insight
- Updates occur immediately after each step, unlike Monte Carlo (which waits for episode end), making it more responsive in ongoing tasks.

### Connection to Q-Learning
- Q-Learning is a form of TD learning applied to action-values.

---

## Q-Learning Visualization
- **Table**: A grid where rows are states, columns are actions, and cells are \(Q(s, a)\) values, updated iteratively.
- **Neural Network (DQN)**: Juliani’s blog extends this to approximate \(Q\) with a neural net for large state spaces (e.g., games).
- **Plot**: Visualize \(Q\) convergence over episodes or reward accumulation.

### Example (Conceptual)
- Grid-world: Agent moves (up, down, left, right), \(Q\)-table updates show preference for reward-reaching actions.

---

## Practical Implementation (Python/TensorFlow)
Based on Juliani’s "Simple RL with TensorFlow" (2016):
```python
import numpy as np
# Q-Learning with Table
Q = np.zeros((4, 2))  # 4 states, 2 actions
alpha, gamma, epsilon = 0.1, 0.9, 0.1
for _ in range(1000):
    s = 0  # Start state
    while s != 3:  # Goal state
        a = np.random.choice(2) if np.random.rand() < epsilon else np.argmax(Q[s])
        s_next = s + 1 if a == 1 else s  # Simplified transition
        r = 1 if s_next == 3 else 0
        Q[s, a] += alpha * (r + gamma * np.max(Q[s_next]) - Q[s, a])
        s = s_next
print(Q)
```

## Applications
- **Games**: Q-Learning in simple grids (Juliani) or DQN in Atari (Sutton’s influence).
- **Robotics**: Learning to grasp objects via trial and error.
