Deep Q-Learning is the result of combining Q-Learning with an Artificial Neural Network. The states of the environment are encoded by a vector which is passed as input into the Neural Network. Then the Neural Network will try to predict which action should be played, by returning as outputs a Q-value for each of the possible actions. Eventually, the best action to play is chosen by either taking the one that has the highest Q-value, or by selecting one at random with a strategy called epsilon-greedy, which is used for exploration.
